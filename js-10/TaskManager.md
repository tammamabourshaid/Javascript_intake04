# Task Manager Application

## User Story 2: Store and Load

The application should be able to store the tasks to the filesystem. It should also be able to load them.

Both commands can be executed by the CLI that has been introduced in User Story 1.

## User Story 3: Deadline

When adding a new task, we should be able to add an optional deadline.

## User Story 4: Finished and History

We should be able to mark an existing task as finished and store the current automatically.

We should also be able to request a history that lists all finished tasks chronologically (latest first).
