  <h1> Why you should visit Japan</h1>

  <p>There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to a favorite place.
    People of all ages, from all countries, travel to foreign places for many different reasons – namely work, family
    and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or automobile, travel is generally a pleasurable experience, at least for
    the people who can financially afford comfortable and safe methods of travel. But it has more benefits than
    satisfying one’s need to make money, as well as to see loved ones and enjoy one’s self on vacation. There are other
    benefits of traveling that many people often overlook.

  <h2>It's a modern country</h2>
  <p> Japan is a perfect mix culture, history and modern comfort. There are skyscrapers, modern restaurants and
    everything else you
    can come across in the modern world. But, Japan does have it’s own unique, modern style and can’t be compared with
    any other
    modern country.</p>

  <h2> Nature</h2>
  <p> Although Japan has big, heavily urbanised cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka,
    there is also a lot of nature to explore. In fact, two thirds of Japan is actually covered by forested mountains and
    hills!
    But in Japan you also have waterfalls, volcanoes, mountains and more.</p>
