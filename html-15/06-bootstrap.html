          Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and one of the largest
          religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring 162.6 hectares
          (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). Originally constructed as a Hindu temple
          dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, it was gradually
          transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th
          century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early
          12th century in Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his
          state temple and eventual mausoleum.

          Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was
          instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site,
          it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre
          since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical
          style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia,
          appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime
          attraction for visitors.
