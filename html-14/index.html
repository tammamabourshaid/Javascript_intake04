            <h2>Angkor Wat</h2>
            <p>
              Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and one of the largest
              religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring 162.6
              hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). Originally constructed as a
              Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, it
              was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end
              of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II
              in the early 12th century in Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the
              Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat
              was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at
              the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant
              religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of
              the high classical style of Khmer architecture.<br />It has become
              a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is
              the country's prime attraction for visitors.
